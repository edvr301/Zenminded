# Zenminded
This was a college project that was created in my second year of college. I was tasked to build a responsive website on any topic and I chose to do it on meditation. We had certain requirements that needed to be met such as a page minimum and for it to have animations. I followed the process of first researching, defining the researching, developing wireframes and prototypes and then coding the website.

I created the website using HTML, CSS and Javascript (only used it for the animations). We were also allowed to use certain bootstrap elements such as the navbar. It was my first time making a responsive website as well!

You can scroll through the website and check out the animations and all the pages.
